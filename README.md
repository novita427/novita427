## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**novita427/novita427** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git and GitHub to improve my version control skills.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source web development projects, especially using PHP, CodeIgniter, or Arduino-based systems.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best practices in collaborative coding and branch management on GitHub.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development with Bootstrap, CodeIgniter, or Arduino projects.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [insert your email or contact info here]

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: I love combining hardware (like Arduino) with software to build interactive tech projects!
